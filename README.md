Skillset: 
I have worked on a range of skills throughout my work life. I worked in business computer support, where I learned computer repair and support, network and server setup, and system maintenance; since then, I have maintained some of these skills on my own projects and maintaining my own equipment, and I have carried these over into new jobs but implemented them in different ways.

I now work in customer service, where I deal with customer issues and computer repairs in-store. This has allowed my communication, problem-solving, and de-escalation skills to improve over the years; the skills I have gained from my previous roles have allowed me to easily complete tasks outside of my usual role in this job.

Iâ€™ve dabbled in multiple programming languages over the years, such as Java, HTML 4, CSS, and PHP, but currently, I only use Scripting languages in my own projects. I am learning C++ and Python through the course.

I actively use Excel Formulas and Visual Basic to design spreadsheets that assist me in daily life. These have been used for everything from financial sheets and task management to calculating information for games I play.

<br>

Recent Projects Completed:
Built multiple small game bots using Auto Hotkey Scripting for a few browser games I play.
Built multiple small C++ programs as part of my course.

<br>

Hobbies: In my own time, I enjoy playing video games and designing solutions to help me in games. I enjoy watching anime and drawing.
